            <H2 class="storycaption">My Story</H2>
            <p class="storyparagraph"> 
                I am an experienced digital technology professional, with a solid background in both software engineering and product management. I've worked across a mix of industries like consulting, healthcare, finance, and education, bringing together technical know-how, business smarts, and strategic thinking. I love tackling tough challenges and creating products that really make a difference, whether it's B2B, B2C, or B2B2C.

                I began my career as a backend engineer, developing software applications with Java and Kotlin then transitioned to product management where I led development teams and championed product development strategies to achieve business goals and objectives
                
                I have recently fallen back in love with solving challenges with code  and now, I am refocusing on web development where I can leverage my diverse industry background to create exceptional web user experiences, drive innovation, and deliver customer value.
                I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge as I am constantly updating, equipping myself, or learning about current trends or newer trends(aren't we all) of technologies . With 5 years of experience in the tech industry, I have proven experience of full stack development across the following (or similar) technologies: Javascript, React, Typescript, Python/fastAPI, PostgresDB,MySql, Data Pipelines. it could be said that I am a generalist thats backend leaning.</p>
        
              <h1 class="whatsnext"> So, What next for me</h1>

              <p class="whatsp">Well, I am stoked about being in the technical dugout again,I want to  and i am currently searching for some full stack engineering role, </p>
